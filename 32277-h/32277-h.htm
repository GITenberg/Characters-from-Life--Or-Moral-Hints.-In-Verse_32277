<p class="poetry">Excess to mankind oft&rsquo;times brings,<br />
Remorse with all its bitter stings;<br />
When cares oppress us in this life.<br />
At times we drink to banish strife;<br />
But when its feeble aid is o&rsquo;er,<br />
We are more wretched then before.<br />
Oft poverty the man disgrace,<br />
And shows a drunkard in his face;<br />
Suppose he is a man of wealth,<br />
Excess of liquor injures health;<br />
Not only health but sad to name,<br />
Such characters the sober blame.<br />
The artful villain tries his skill,<br />
When Bacchus gains us to his will;<br />
At such unguarded times disclose,<br />
What makes our valued friends our foes;<br />
And many an injured wife declares<br />
That Bacchus cause her many tears.<br />
The husband oft to harlots stray,<br />
Whene&rsquo;er he bears a sovereign&rsquo;s sway;<br />
<!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>And by his aid the thoughtless youth,<br />
Is led from virtues paths and truth:<br />
Oh gentle youth the harlot&rsquo;s smile,<br />
Is given only to beguile;<br />
Their conversation so impure,<br />
That men of sense them can&rsquo;t endure;<br />
Be chaste in every thought I pray,<br />
Sweet modesty will gain the day;<br />
Bacchus with her can not contend,<br />
She is to every youth a friend.<br />
Oft do I see a good man&rsquo;s son,<br />
By harlots ruined and undone;<br />
A tipling farmer oft complain,<br />
Much is too low the price of grain;<br />
He must acknowledge oft he meet,<br />
His wealthy landlord in the street;<br />
On Saturdays his landlord roam,<br />
A few miles from his gaudy home;<br />
To this tho&rsquo; ancient pretty city,<br />
To see a play denoted pretty:<br />
Oft in the boxes folks call green,<br />
The tenant with his wife is seen;<br />
His spending money in that way,<br />
Good sense and learning then display;<br />
When farmers hurt themselves is clear,<br />
Is riding home and drunk appear.<br />
<!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>Driving their horses at a rate,<br />
As plain foretell they staid too late;<br />
The gig turn&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er an arm is broke,<br />
Don&rsquo;t this his landlord much provoke.<br />
Some neighbour who may want his farm,<br />
Take care the village to alarm;<br />
Informs his neighbours he can&rsquo;t pay<br />
His tithe till sold both corn and hay;<br />
And to his landlord slyly state,<br />
That ruin&rsquo;d soon must be his fate;<br />
His neighbour was in liquor found,<br />
Senseless and bleeding on the ground;<br />
On going home he drove so fast,<br />
As if each minute was his last;<br />
He&rsquo;d broke his gig and spoilt his mare,<br />
This Sir is true I do declare;<br />
What I now state to others name,<br />
And they will tell you just the same;<br />
Sir cried the landlord in a pat,<br />
He knows not what he would be at;<br />
Quickly his mind I will alarm,<br />
For I will turn him out his farm;<br />
To me he&rsquo;s tenant but at will,<br />
Soon soon he&rsquo;ll be on Castle-Hill;<br />
I instant will the sot distress,<br />
And others will him sharply press;<br />
<!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>Sir cries his neighbour should that be,<br />
I hope you&rsquo;ll give me liberty;<br />
To offer you a great deal more,<br />
Then ere you let his farm before;<br />
I have two bondsmen at my call,<br />
One lives you know at such a hall;<br />
The other friend is Banker Steady,<br />
They both to serve me Sir are ready!<br />
Sir cries the landlord you keep sober,<br />
And only drink your own October;<br />
I&rsquo;ll promise what you&rsquo;ve ask&rsquo;d of me,<br />
And you my tenant soon shall be;<br />
I&rsquo;ll send the bailiffs on his place,<br />
And that will bring him to disgrace;<br />
The slanderer says pray sir don&rsquo;t state,<br />
What I to you this day relate;<br />
No says the landlord, I&rsquo;ll not say,<br />
What you have told me on this day;<br />
This slanderer I do know well,<br />
And only do the truth now tell;<br />
Most farmers whose estates are large,<br />
Their public duty well discharge;<br />
They live on such a handsome plan,<br />
As note and mark them gentlemen;<br />
I do protest it is great pity,<br />
Some drink so hard when in this city;<br />
<!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>As when rattling o&rsquo;er the stones,<br />
They break a poor old woman&rsquo;s bones;<br />
Or by his trotting horse knock&rsquo;d down,<br />
Before he leaves a market town;<br />
I do but state what many view,<br />
And Norwich surgeons know its true.<br />
Good farmers I do much esteem,<br />
And therefore make them oft my theme;<br />
May every farmer when he dine,<br />
Have means to drink a pint of wine.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">on viewing the</span><br />
CATTLE MARKET<br />
<span class="smcap">on the</span><br />
<span class="smcap">castle hill</span>.</h2>
<p class="poetry">The wealthy farmer with a rosy hue,<br />
Weekly attends the hardy scot to view;<br />
The pretty homebred soon his eye detain,<br />
Views and admires, then chat in lively strain;<br />
Of natures produce till his business call<br />
Him from such pleasing sights to pace the hall;<br />
Soon as he sees his merchant at his stand,<br />
He shows the produce of his fertile land;<br />
I&rsquo;ll give you such a price the merchant say,<br />
A higher bidder you&rsquo;ll not find this day.<br />
<!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>But ere the farmer quits the hill he view,<br />
All other stock to find out something new;<br />
A thought then strikes him as the season&rsquo;s fine,<br />
I&rsquo;ll buy a few score sheep before I dine;<br />
Into the pens he hies, the bargain struck,<br />
The jobber takes his cash, wish him good luck.<br />
Prehaps his steed don&rsquo;t travel to his mind,<br />
Looks at the nags, and do a good one find;<br />
The price he thinks too high, but not refrain,<br />
Making another bid the horse to gain;<br />
The dealer tempted by the offer say,<br />
Sir I&rsquo;ll comply don&rsquo;t hurry so away;<br />
Lets take a glass of wine to wish success<br />
To your new purchase&mdash;hard the farmer press,<br />
The nag is taken from the stand with glee;<br />
Another takes his place with broken knee,<br />
The buyer says what have you standing here?<br />
A damaged one a tumbling one I fear;<br />
Sir cries the dealer as your land is light,<br />
Take him for plough he&rsquo;s pretty to the sight;<br />
No it can&rsquo;t be, you must be in a joke,<br />
Sure I can&rsquo;t see, or else his knees are broke;<br />
But Sir the price I ask will claim a bid,<br />
I have so many that I want to rid;<br />
Ten guineas for him Sir to you I&rsquo;ll take,<br />
A useful one to you I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll make:<br />
<!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>The farmer cries before I quit the ground,<br />
I&rsquo;ll make an offer which is Sir ten pound;<br />
It is accepted&mdash;and away goes nag,<br />
The wealthy farmer draws the canvas bag.<br />
Now to the tavern blithsome they repair,<br />
Take wine and wish that liquor wan&rsquo;t so dear;<br />
Looks at his watch, then loud the buyer cry,<br />
Its half past one, I to the hall must hie!<br />
Sell as much corn as shall be in my power,<br />
I&rsquo;m much afraid the markets will be lower.<br />
I&rsquo;ve sold he cried my wheat and barley well,<br />
I wish I could my oats and horse beans sell;<br />
Straight to his merchant &rsquo;gain the farmer hop,<br />
Fearful next market day all things will drop;<br />
The cautious merchant on his skill rely,<br />
And thinks Mark-Lane will have a small supply;<br />
Contrary winds will keep the vessels back,<br />
And in his purchase he will not be slack.<br />
Only one thought now harass much his brain,<br />
He fears to Banker&rsquo;s shop to go again;<br />
Least he should meet rebuke and irksome scorn,<br />
On casting up he found he&rsquo;d overdrawn<br />
A running mortgage please the banker&rsquo;s mind,<br />
Gains it and to the merchant is more kind;<br />
But disappointment all his efforts blast,<br />
A large supply is usher&rsquo;d in at last;<br />
<!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>Mark-Lane is full and markets now decline,<br />
A large supply and weather very fine;<br />
The malsters leaving off they&rsquo;ll wet no more,<br />
And only clear what is upon the floor;<br />
Merchants there are now dwelling in this place,<br />
That often routs their handsome houses grace;<br />
Gigs very fine a livery servant too,<br />
Is always kept to hide what&rsquo;s known by few;<br />
That his expences far exceeds his gain,<br />
And that the banker mortgages retain;<br />
On each estate the gaudy thing has bought,<br />
And that in real wealth not worth a groat.<br />
Still he goes on till on a sudden stray,<br />
Away awhile and cant the farmer pay;<br />
Flies to his factor in the time of need,<br />
For an advance but do not there succeed.<br />
Some characters like those I do know well,<br />
They can&rsquo;t last long they cut so great a swell;<br />
Oft do we see a very handsome coach,<br />
A merchant sport, and meriting reproach;<br />
Because full well he knows his books must show,<br />
His ranting on has brought him very low;<br />
When that&rsquo;s the case too often others find,<br />
A gig or coach is kept the eye to blind;<br />
To every honest man I wish success,<br />
And may misfortune never on them press.</p>

11</span>THE LION<br />
<span class="smcap">and the</span><br />
<i>ORANGE GROVE</i>.</h2>
<p class="poetry">Three Jackalls were a prawling sent<br />
It is supposed with ill intent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At least to make a prey:<br />
On any thing they saw was good;<br />
So dashing furious in a wood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They seiz&rsquo;d without delay,</p>
<p class="poetry">An Orange Tree well hung with fruit,<br />
It apt the Lion&rsquo;s taste to suit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By Jackalls forced away.<br />
The owner of the tree declares,<br />
He&rsquo;ll strip the Lion of his ears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or make him sharply pay.</p>
<p class="poetry">So to it furiously they went,<br />
He&rsquo;ll make the Lion soon repent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For seizing others store.<br />
He crav&rsquo;d for mercy night and day;<br />
The Owner of the fruit won&rsquo;t stay!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But will him sadly gore.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sharp pains ran down his aching side,<br />
The Lion on his knees loud cried,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I will do so no more.<br />
The orange man declar&rsquo;d with glee,<br />
Your minion sha&rsquo;nt have liberty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To enter here no more.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ne&rsquo;er shall you have the power to take<br
/>
My fruit away for hunger sake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>But I will have a change;<br />
My tale of woe none can deny,<br />
You know your master dwells on high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He soon will stop your range.</p>
<p class="poetry">He wears a fur more grand to view,<br />
And is more merciful than you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your arrogance he&rsquo;ll stop;<br />
He&rsquo;ll quickly with a little chain,<br />
Your nightly prowlings soon restrain;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And your ambition lop.</p>
<p class="poetry">He was allowed no more to stray,<br />
With hungry Jackalls night or day;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Orange trees are seen.<br />
It serv&rsquo;d him right to stop his power,<br />
Or he would each succeeding hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pluck Oranges too green.</p>
<p class="poetry">Besides there is a law that&rsquo;s known,<br
/>
We should take nothing but our own,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From either beast or man.<br />
Tho&rsquo; power is given to us here,<br />
We should the little lambs revere,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And serve them if we can.</p>
<p class="poetry">I hope this will a warning prove,<br />
To other Lions in the grove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who may hereafter stray:<br />
By power or order to a place,<br />
And not incur the like disgrace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We witness&rsquo;d t&rsquo;other day.</p>
<p class="poetry">The low bred minions seek to bind,<br />
The smaller ones of gentler kind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But in this happy Isle;<br />
A savage beast is laid aside,<br />
For every Reptile to deride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or hourly to revile.</p>

<p class="poetry">Farewell ye partner of my woes, farewell!<br />
The finest language could but faintly tell,<br />
What I now feel in writing this adieu,<br />
What you must suffer when I&rsquo;m far from you.<br />
There was a time when happiness my lot,<br />
I liv&rsquo;d serenely in my little cot;<br />
No wicked thoughts did then disturb my rest,<br />
My children round me, by a father prest;<br />
No father now, methinks I hear them say,<br />
He&rsquo;s gone from us, he&rsquo;s hurried far away.<br />
Nightly I&rsquo;ve view&rsquo;d them in my flurri&rsquo;d
dreams,<br />
Seen their wet eyes and heard their dreadful screams;<br />
Methought my wife came to my lonely cell,<br />
To say adieu, to bid a long farewell;<br />
Soon I awoke and to increase my pains,<br />
I felt my legs encompass&rsquo;d round with chains;<br />
Then, then I cried oh drunkenness thou cause,<br />
Of this distress, and made me break those laws<br />
That wise men made for every man to keep,<br />
By them deluded, plung&rsquo;d in crimes so deep.<br />
First step to ruin was a love of dice,<br />
With cards the great promoter of our vice;<br />
I wish those men who do with such things play,<br />
Would ever cast them from their hands away;<br />
<!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>I wish all Magistrates would search around,<br />
And punish Publicans where they are found:<br />
They caused me first my Master to neglect,<br />
And after lost me honest men&rsquo;s respect;<br />
They also led me from a virtuous wife,<br />
And mostly caused me sad disgrace and strife.<br />
View Public Houses, every wealthy Squire,<br />
And force by ten, the spendthrift to retire;<br />
By such a plan, the labouring poor would rise,<br />
Soon as the Sun adorns the heavenly skies:<br />
I&rsquo;ve stated what have brought me to this end,<br />
And what has lost me every earthly friend;<br />
Except a wife&mdash;oh God protect and bless,<br />
Her and our offspring now in great distress.<br />
Young men be cautious how ye spend your time,<br />
A bad acquaintance hurries on a crime;<br />
Sometimes an artful female tries her power,<br />
To trap the giddy in a thoughtless hour;<br />
When she has work&rsquo;d the captive to her will,<br />
She gladly sees you taking sorrow&rsquo;s pill;<br />
Cause you to leave a virtuous homely wife,<br />
And lead a sad disgraceful wicked life;<br />
Allur&rsquo;d by art she&rsquo;ll bring you to distress,<br />
And like a Millwood to you falsely press;<br />
Then be the first your actions to betray,<br />
A fiend like such caused me to go astray<br />
<!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>From them I love, from those my heart hold dear,<br />
And shall till death their memories revere;<br />
When I am clos&rsquo;d in transport on the sea,<br />
Doubtless my love you&rsquo;ll sometimes sigh for me.<br />
Bring up my little ones in such a way,<br />
As they will holy keep the sabbath-day;<br />
Early in life do in their minds reveal,<br />
The dreadful crimes to swear, to lie, or steal.<br />
Hannah my eldest daughter place her where,<br />
She&rsquo;s constant under virtue&rsquo;s eye and care;<br />
Let her not learn the weaving trade, you&rsquo;ll find,<br />
That such a course may injure much her mind;<br />
Females are ready to acquire that art,<br />
Soon as they wish fair virtue to depart;<br />
Unwilling oft in service for to be,<br />
Where they can&rsquo;t dress and have their liberty;<br />
But if with parents they can work at home,<br />
Nightly they hope with idle folks to roam:<br />
At my late sentence I can not complain,<br />
Altho&rsquo; the law my body do detain;<br />
Justice tho&rsquo; slow has overtaken me,<br />
Abroad for life, I shall be kept from thee;<br />
On a just God for ever I will trust,<br />
I know his will is always right and just.<br />
Tis now too late again to speak to you,<br />
Which is the cause of writing this adieu.<br />
<!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>No partner now to sooth my aching heart,<br />
Reflection galls me, at myself I start,<br />
With aching heart and in my lonely cell,<br />
I bid my babes and you&mdash;a long farewell.<br />
Methinks I see the transport full in view,<br />
And I with horror meet the harden&rsquo;d crew;<br />
Full well I know I ne&rsquo;er shall see you more,<br />
Nor plant a foot-step on my native shore;<br />
On foreign land I&rsquo;m doom&rsquo;d my days to toil,<br />
And with vile wretches cultivate the soil.<br />
Stripes I must bear perhaps when quite unwell,<br />
And hear the convicts&rsquo; melancholy yell;<br />
A pang I feel when e&rsquo;er I close the night,<br />
And wish a virtuous wife was in my sight:<br />
England adieu, may you in trade increase,<br />
And free from inward tumults rest in peace.<br />
Our chaplain well I know, will soon impart,<br />
His friendly aid to cheer the drooping heart;<br />
I hope my children he will learn to read,<br />
And teach them early to peruse the creed:<br />
The bell is rung, the waggon is in view,<br />
Wife and dear children now, adieu! adieu!<br />
At thoughts of leaving this my native shore,<br />
Unmans me quite and I can say no more;<br />
I will thro&rsquo; life, a better course pursue,<br />
Tho&rsquo; far away still leave my heart with you.</p>

17</span><i>ADVICE</i>, &amp;c.</h2>
<p class="poetry">Vile man, abstain from every artful plan,<br />
When found out disgrace the name of man;<br />
Let those who steal, repent and sin no more,<br />
Ere Law decrees, it&rsquo;s vengeance on them pour;<br />
From trifling things, we greater ills pursue,<br />
Till the Law&rsquo;s fangs are brought within our view;<br />
Stop, stop bad courses, ere it be too late,<br />
And justice dooms you to a culprit&rsquo;s fate.<br />
Riots avoid, tho&rsquo; mischief none you do,<br />
Your being at them, brings a stain on you;<br />
Those who look on, will afterwards repent,<br />
And share alike in point of punishment:<br />
The Law expressly properly declare,<br />
He adds to tumult, that is present there;<br />
Take my advice, let reason bear her sway,<br />
From scenes of discord, always keep away;<br />
You&rsquo;d think it hard, a worthless savage crew,<br />
Should gain by plunder, all your goods from you:<br />
The worst of men are foremost on a plan,<br />
To gain by rapine every way they can;<br />

Can ease the hardships of the labouring poor;<br />

Dreadful his fate, that strikes confusion&rsquo;s blow;<br />
Then let us quiet at our cots remain,<br />
And better times will cheer us once again.<br />
All means are trying comforts to restore,<br />
To ease the hardships of the labouring poor;<br />
Think what distress awaits dishonest ways,<br />
Immured in prison many wretched days;<br />
Not only days, perhaps they shed their tears,<br />
In Foreign Lands for many dismal years;<br />
Not only years perhaps are doom&rsquo;d for life,<br />
Abroad to roam, from children, home and wife:<br />
Should it your lot in prison for to be,<br />
Implore with fervent prayer the Deity;<br />
Who will in time if you sincerely pray,<br />
Lessen your troubles each succeeding day:<br />
It&rsquo;s thro&rsquo; our Saviour&rsquo;s aid that we should
crave,<br />
A gracious pardon ere we meet the grave;<br />
His intercession with the King of Kings,<br />
Alone can save you from eternal stings.<br />
When at the court, for trial you appear,<br />
Speak nought but truth, you better for it fare;<br />
For should you dare to introduce a lie,<br />
Justice&rsquo;s sharp eye each falsehood will descry:<br />
I&rsquo;ve known a perjur&rsquo;d witness brought to swear,<br />
The guilty felon, of his crime is clear:<br />
Dismay&rsquo;d, confus&rsquo;d, he feels alas! too late,<br />
Such impious conduct greatly aggravate;<br />

For causing others from the truth to stray.<br />
Whatever happens in this vale of tears,<br />
Our Maker knows, give him your fervent prayers:<br />
Let your demeanor if in prison be,<br />
Such as the jailor can contrition see;<br />
For his report may mitigate your doom,<br />
And sometimes save you from a prison&rsquo;s gloom.<br />
Religious Books if you can read attend,<br />
They are in solitude the pris&rsquo;ner&rsquo;s friend;<br />
When at the Chapel, do not cast away,<br />
By inattention what the Chaplain say:<br />
It&rsquo;s pure Religion cheers each good man&rsquo;s heart,<br

And will in time its blessings soon impart;<br />
Such as perhaps you never knew before,<br />
And doubtless will your peace of mind restore.<br />
The Bible read when in your dismal cell,<br />
Read it attentive, ere you bid farewell;<br />
To him who may companion with you be;<br />
Your soul that night may be required of thee.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A scene I witnessed, and not long time since,<br />
Would stop the errors of an hardened prince;<br />
Three men were sentenc&rsquo;d by the law to die,<br />
To hear them mourn, to see the drooping eye;<br />
Would cause sensations of a painful kind,<br />
While anxious cares oppress the tortur&rsquo;d mind.<br />
<!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>A pious Chaplain strove, to bring in view,<br />
The proffer&rsquo;d pardon if repentants true.<br />
He said that God was merciful and just,<br />
To implore forgiveness, on his word to trust;<br />
There is a record where the scripture say,<br />
Those that repent he will not cast away;<br />
A sigh or tear cannot that boon impart,<br />
It must be fervent from the head and heart:<br />
Thro&rsquo; Jesus&rsquo; aid vile sinners doth he save,<br />
If true repentants, ere they meet the grave.<br />
Each wish&rsquo;d they could recal, the time that&rsquo;s
past,<br />
And they would live as if each day the last:<br />
Just before death, they pray&rsquo;d me to implore,<br />
An erring mortal to transgress no more;<br />
Hope their lov&rsquo;d Chaplain might for ever be<br />
When call&rsquo;d on high, blessed to eternity;<br />
They knew his worth his heart is of a kind,<br />
That plants soft pity to a feeling mind;<br />
Deeker as Chaplain, few can e&rsquo;er excel,<br />
Belov&rsquo;d by all who bid the jail farewell.<br />
When first I saw these wretched men in jail,<br />
Before their trial did their fate bewail;<br />
Soon as the sentence met each anxious ear,<br />
Resign&rsquo;d and true repentants did appear;<br />
One and all cried out, oh that God how just!<br />
To stop our sad career, on thee we&rsquo;ll trust;<br />
One cause alone have made this sad distress,<br />
Neglecting Lord&rsquo;s day and our drunkenness.</p>

Careless the pangs a husband feel,<br />

Was you a married man what pain,<br />
Was e&rsquo;er a faithless friend to gain.<br />
Your wife&rsquo;s affection from your view,<br />
And bid each moral plan adieu;<br />
This truth to you I&rsquo;m sure is known,<br />
Then scan such case as if your own:<br />
Juries are often kind its true,<br />
I&rsquo;m sure they have been so to you.<br />
There is a judge that dwells on high,<br />
Will all the arts of man descry:<br />
Admit you didn&rsquo;t your game obtain,<br />
Did you from wicked thoughts abstain?<br />

Wealth may a short time foibles blind,<br />
But, does it ease the guilty mind?<br />
The adultress with her paramour<br />
Ought personally sharp pains endure.<br />
Send them afar to foreign land,<br />

There&rsquo;s scarce a crime on earth more vile,<br />
Then artless women to beguile.<br />
The wretch that&rsquo;s guilty of that sin,<br />
On females does great anguish bring,<br />
Levity too often leads astray,<br />

Women to break the marriage laws;<br />
And pity &rsquo;tis I do declare,<br />
Many so gaudy should appear:<br />
Soon as distress awaits the fair,<br />
Madam is clad in deep despair;<br />
Her sorrow is of selfish kind,<br />
Not gaining things quite to her mind.<br />

Now had the husband taught his wife,<br />
Economy throughout his life<br />
More easy she&rsquo;d have kept at home,<br />
But he allowed her oft to roam;<br />
To plays and balls and such like places,<br />
Where giddy wantons show their faces.<br />
Actions are brought large damages to gain,<br />
Which must give every thinking bosom pain;<br />
Some trifling want of proper evidence,<br />
May give a british jury just pretence,<br />
To give acquittal, then the parties smile,<br />
To think how much the public they beguile.<br />
Still keen remorse embitters every joy,<br />
Altho&rsquo; the parties can by bribes decoy:<br />
Such hirelings as their influence can bind,<br />
And clap a padlock on the tongue and mind.</p>

To make me worthy of the wife I love:<br />
Return, and till my days are at an end,<br />
I&rsquo;ll prove protector, guardian, and a friend.<br />
The converse delicate; the smile sincere,<br />

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
